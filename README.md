# Digital Investigation (Simulated Case)
## Overview
This lab simulates a digital forensic investigation associated with a student’s death. The objective is to analyse digital evidence from multiple devices, including disk images, memory dumps, network captures, and mobile devices. All analysis and documentation follow accepted digital forensic procedures and best practices, ensuring that findings are structured in a way that could be considered court-admissible. The investigation focuses on reconstructing events, identifying relevant artefacts, and documenting findings to support a structured forensic case study.

The investigation includes the following pieces of evidence:

- **Evidence A** – Desktop computer found in the student’s dorm room  
- **Evidence B** – Network capture from the dormitory network  
- **Evidence C** – Memory dump of a personal laptop found in the student’s bedroom  
- **Evidence D** – Disk image of a damaged mobile phone found in the student’s apartment
