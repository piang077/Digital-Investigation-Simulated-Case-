# Digital Investigation Lab

## Overview
This lab simulates a digital forensic investigation on multiple devices. The purpose is to identify evidence, analyse system and network activity, and reconstruct a timeline of events.

---

## Objectives
- Preserve and analyse disk images and memory dumps  
- Investigate network captures  
- Recover deleted or hidden files  
- Trace communications and reconstruct events  
- Document findings clearly for reporting purposes

---

## Tools Used
- Autopsy  
- Wireshark  
- Volatility  
- Network Miner  
- Sleuth Kit  
- rip.pl

---

## Methodology
1. Acquired disk and memory images using forensic best practices.  
2. Analysed system logs and network captures for suspicious activity.  
3. Recovered deleted files and other artefacts.  
4. Compiled evidence and reconstructed the sequence of events in a timeline.  
5. Documented findings for reporting.

## Findings
- [Briefly describe key observations, e.g., malware presence, suspicious processes, recovered files]  
- [Summarise how the events were reconstructed]

## Outcome
The lab demonstrated practical digital forensic skills, including evidence preservation, analysis, and reporting. The investigation successfully reconstructed events and identified key artefacts from the simulated scenario.
